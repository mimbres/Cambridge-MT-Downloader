# Cambridge-MT-Downloader
Auto-downloader and preprocessor for Cambridge-MT (multitrack) data

## About
This repository provides a `Python` script that automatically downloads and resamples the [Cambridge-MT](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) dataset.  The Cambridge-MT dataset is a collection of over 500 studio-quality multi-track audio recordings of various music genres, including pop, rock, EDM, classical, and folk. The dataset follows the format of [MedleyDB](https://medleydb.weebly.com/), but is larger. It can be used for tasks such as `music source separation`, `generation`, `transcription`, and `automatic mixing`.

**Note**: 
- This repository is an unofficial tool for accessing the [Cambridge-MT](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) dataset, and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the dataset creators.
- This script was originally generated by `ChatGPT` and has been revised by [@mimbres](https://github.com/mimbres).
- The [page_source.py](https://github.com/mimbres/Cambridge-MT-Downloader/blob/main/page_source.py) is from the [preview](https://multitracksearch.cambridge-mt.com/ms-mtk-search-ads.htm) website of Cambridge-MT. 

## Install & Run
```cli
apt-get install sox && pip install -r requirements.txt # Linux
```
In MacOS, use `brew` instead of `apt-get` installer.

```
python run.py
```
This will launch a prompt that allows you to configure `output_dir`, `num_workers` and `output_audio_format`.

## How it works
```css
ðŸ’»[PageSource] --> ðŸšš  [Download] --> ðŸ“¦ [Extract] --> ðŸŽ§ [Convert audio format]
```

**TODO**:
- [ ] Instrument labeling: Cambridge-MT uses a simple file naming convention in the format of `ID_INSTRUMENT_MIC_ETC.*`.
